3. Require it in your emacs config

If you use [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs), there is a [leetcode-emacs-layer](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/leetcode-emacs-layer). Thanks for [Anmol Jagetia](https://github.com/anmoljagetia)!

# Configuration

You can set your preferred LeetCode programming language and SQL by setting `leetcode-prefer-language` and `leetcode-prefer-sql`:

```elisp
(setq leetcode-prefer-language "python3")
(setq leetcode-prefer-sql "mysql")
```

All supported languages can be found in variable `leetcode--prefer-language-suffixes`.

| p      | cursor move up                         |
| s      | filter problem by regex                |
| t      | filter problem by tag                  |
| /      | clear filters                          |
| g      | refresh without fetching from LeetCode |
| G      | refresh all data                       |
| RET    | show current problem description       |

2. Press `<RET>`, show problem description, move cursor to "solve it", press `<RET>` again, start coding!

# Contributing

This package use [Cask](https://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/introduction.html) to develop, build and test.

It is a suggestion for you to use `Cask`, but if you don't want to bother to use it, it's totally fine too.

`Cask` is a build tools for emacs lisp, you can think it of `npm` for emacs lisp.

Enter project root, execute `cask install`, this command will install all dependencies. After that, execute `cask emacs` which will start a emacs with extra `load-path` to load dependencies.
