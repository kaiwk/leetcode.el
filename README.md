[![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/leetcode-badge.svg)](https://melpa.org/#/leetcode)
# Introduction

LeetCode brings you offer, and now Emacs brings you LeetCode!

# Installation

- Vanilla Emacs: `package-install` it from melpa directly
- [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs):
  [leetcode-emacs-layer](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/leetcode-emacs-layer)

LeetCode do not allow third party login, one workaround is restore LeetCode
session from local Firefox or Chrome cookies. By default, this package will
install a Python3 package called
[my\_cookies](https://github.com/kaiwk/my_cookies), or you can install it
manually: `pip3 install my_cookies`.

## Manually

1. Clone this repository and install all dependencies
2. Move it to your load-path
3. Require it in your emacs config

# Configuration

You can set your preferred LeetCode programming language and SQL by setting
`leetcode-prefer-language` and `leetcode-prefer-sql`:

```elisp
(setq leetcode-prefer-language "python3")
(setq leetcode-prefer-sql "mysql")
```

All supported languages can be found in variable
`leetcode--prefer-language-suffixes`.

You can save solution by setting `leetcode-save-solutions`:

```elisp
(setq leetcode-save-solutions t)
(setq leetcode-directory "~/leetcode")
```

# Usage

In leetcode problems list buffer:

| keymap | command                                |
|--------|----------------------------------------|
| n      | cursor move down                       |
| p      | cursor move up                         |
| s      | filter problems by regex               |
| t      | filter problems by tag                 |
| d      | filter problems by difficulty          |
| /      | clear filters                          |
| g      | refresh without fetching from LeetCode |
| G      | refresh all data                       |
| RET    | show current problem description       |

2. Press `<RET>`, show problem description, move cursor to "solve it", press
   `<RET>` again, start coding!

3. After finishing your code, you can edit testcase and execute `leetcode-try`
   or execute `leetcode-submit`.
